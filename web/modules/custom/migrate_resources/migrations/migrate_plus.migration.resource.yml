  # The data_parser normally limits the fields passed on to the source plugin
  # to fields configured to be used as part of the migration. To support more
  # dynamic migrations, the JSON data parser supports including the original
  # data for the current row. Simply include the 'include_raw_data' flag set
  # to `true` to enable this. This option is disabled by default to minimize
  # memory footprint for migrations that do not need this capability.
  # include_raw_data: true
  # Flags whether to track changes to incoming data. If TRUE, we will maintain
  # hashed source rows to determine whether incoming data has changed.
  # track_changes: true
  # Copy the example JSON file in artifacts folder to sites/default/files folder.

  # An xpath-like selector corresponding to the items to be imported.
  item_selector: records

  # Under 'fields', we list the data items to be imported. The first level keys
  # are the source field names we want to populate (the names to be used as
  # sources in the process configuration below). For each field we're importing,
  # we provide a label (optional - this is for display in migration tools) and
  # an xpath for retrieving that value. It's important to note that this xpath
  # is relative to the elements retrieved by item_selector.
